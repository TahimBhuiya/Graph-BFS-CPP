# Breadth-First Search (BFS) in C++

## 📌 Overview

This C++ program demonstrates the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm, a fundamental graph traversal method that explores nodes **level by level** using a queue.

Steps BFS follows:

1. Starts from a chosen source node.
2. Visits all immediate neighbors first.
3. Moves outward layer by layer.
4. Ensures the shortest path (in edges) in unweighted graphs.

It prints the BFS traversal order starting from node `0`.
