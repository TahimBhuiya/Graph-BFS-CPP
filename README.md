# Breadth-First Search (BFS) in C++

## 📌 Overview

This C++ program demonstrates the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm, a fundamental graph traversal method that explores nodes **level by level** using a queue.

Steps BFS follows:

1. Starts from a chosen source node.
2. Visits all immediate neighbors first.
3. Moves outward layer by layer.
